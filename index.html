		<h3>May 5th, 2013</h3>
		<p>Greetings to you all.</p>
		<p>I just wanted to say a few words about the passing of our Father William S. Graham.</p> 
		<p>It is common in our society to have some sort of family gathering after the passing of a family member. However, times have changed and so have the ways that we live and communicate. Currently our family is scattered in various cities across this country making it difficult to have some sort of family reunion or gathering. It is the wishes of Mom/Grandma/Audrey to have a ceremony in August,to distribute the ashes at some meaningful place in Michigan.</p>
		<p>However, with such a passing, I feel it's would be nice to have a more immediate gathering and discussion of the event even if its via email, Facebook or blog. But really to survive as a family unit and celebrate all the good things about Dads life.</p>
		<p>I think it's important to remember all the good things that Dad did and who he was. First and foremost, he was a father and bread winner for the family which made it possible for a  decent lifestyle and upbringing for his family of 8.</p>
		<p>Secondly, between him and Mom we had a lot of fun weekend camping trips to Lake Geneva, Devils Lake and other places. And long vacations all over the country: West Coast, Rocky Mountains, Grand Tetons, Yosemite, Yellow Stone, and the Old Faithful Geyser, Glacier National Park, and the Pacific Northwest to name a few.</p>
		<p>These trips were all made possible by mom and dad's planning, engineering, finance, and execution of complicated travel plans including family of eight jammed into a Plymouth station wagon, and a pop top camper trailer.</p>
		<p>I remember traveling through Glacier National Park in the middle of summer, and stopping to make snowballs and having an impromptu snowball fight on the side of the road. Then getting back in the car with numb hands and fingers, finding the warm space between the second and third row seats to be warm enough to warm my hands despite the coldness of the day and the rest of the car.</p>
		
		<p>I remember going to the beach in Oregon and seeing for the first time a Beach surfer run down the beach and skim along the shallow water on a flat disc.</p>
		<p>These trips, experiences, and memories and many more were all made possible because of initiative, planning and hard work of mom and dad.  It was a good up bringing. And I do appreciate what it must have taken to pull this off with such a big family.</p>
		<p>There were many other positive experiences and help I got from dad, like helping me buy my first car.</p>
		<p>That's all I will say for now and I would like to encourage you all to you share some of your favorite experiences with dad over his lifetime. Please send copy to all on the above list so everybody can see your contribution.</p>
		<p>In summing up I would just like to say thank you Dad for your caring and concern for our safety & well-being.</p>
		<p>Rest in peace.</p>
		<p>Your son,</p> 
		<p>Michael</p>

		<p>Mike, I just wanted to say this email tribute is a great idea. Dad spent his life working with computers so it seem a very fitting way to communicate after his passing.</p>
		<p>I think Dad would think sharing our feeling over the miles via computers is the best idea ever. I will be gathering my thoughts and a few pictures and post them here in the next few days.</p> 
		<p>Thanks for sharing yours.</p> 
		<p>Love to all,</p>
		<p>Dianne</p>

		<p>Mike. I will try to get something written this week and go through photos and slides to see what I have.  How well I remember those long vacation trips in the station wagons and pop up trailer. </p>
		<p>Thanks for your memories!</p>  
		<p>Bro Bill</p>

		<p>Memories about my Dad, William S Graham...</p>

<p>Who was Bill Graham?  He was someone different to each of us and yet someone similar in many ways. I think he lived a full and rewarding life. He was a son and brother. From the stories I heard it sounds like he was a challenging child -starting the piano in the living room on fire.  He was a husband, a father, a grandfather, a great grandfather, a friend, a data processing/ computer guy, a camper, and a sailor.</p>

<p>He was Dad to us six kids which was quite a responsibility. He was lucky to have our Mom at his side. As a young child I remember he worked very long hours. The start of a long career with computers. He often came home crabby. Us kids tried to lay low and be on our best behavior so we wouldn't need disciplining. He mellowed as the years went by. He taught me how to drive when I was 16 (and was quite patient). He was often the one who picked me up from my job at the local drugstore.</p> 

<p>Like Mike, I remember many camping expeditions. My favorite was Lake Tahoe. I'm not sure I could handle driving cross-country with six kids in the back. Tom, who didn't want "the sun getting him" seemed to always get the shady side of the car. It was always fun to stop at a fast food place for lunch when we were on the road. Otherwise Mom cooked ALL the meals.  On many of the weekend Camping trips, I remember being allowed to bring a friend along (like six kids wasn't enough). Looking back, these were great memories - the kind of stuff LIFE is made of.</p> 

<p>Then in my high school years we began to go to FL for spring break. Our vacations to FL probably were the seeds to Mom & Dad eventually retiring there.</p>
  
<p>When dating, John remembers me pouring a glass of water over Dads head at the Lombard house. Then  being the recipient of water in the face (which was meant for me) when he opened the front door.</p>  
<p>Dad offered advice and encouragement when John & I bought our first house.  Mom and Dad helped with my college tuition (even after I was married).  Dad worked at getting his own college degree while working full time.</p> 

<p>Before he knew it, he was the Grandfather of ten. He became fondly known as Grumpy because he would growl at them.  I would like to thank him and Mom for taking Jill under their wing when she moved to FL. I know it made a difference in her life.
 And now he has started on a new generation of Great Grand Kids -- Ten so far, another on the way, and many more to come I'm sure.</p> 

<p>Dad spent his life in data processing/computers so I think he would smile to know we are sharing his memory through a group email via computer. During the time I spent working with him at the rehab center we became closer. The amount of effort he put into his therapy was incredible. And he was always making jokes with the nurses. In the end he was lucky to have Mom to take him home.</p>
<p>Rest in Peace Dad,</p> 
<p>Your Daughter</p>
<p>Dianne</p>
<p>Also sending pictures I found to share. Sending in separate email cause I know I would mess something up.</p>

<h3>May 8, 2013</h3>
<p>That's great. Thanks Dianne for sharing that with us.</p>
<p>You brought up a lot of things I hadn't remembered.</p>
<p>Michael</p>
